The object list merger was deployed on the robot. Based on different observations we finally selected 2 modalities to be delpoyed 
on the robot.
1. RGB-D sensor
2. RGB wideangle sensor

Based on the 2 modalities we used 3 different algorithms were used for object detection and recognition
1. RGB-D-Based Features for Recognition of Textureless Objects[1]
2. DeeplabV3 [2]
3. Mobilenet [3]
